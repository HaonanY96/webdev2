# Weekly Announcements

## Before Start of Semester

Title: Welcome to CPRG-306!

Welcome to Web Development 2! In this course we'll explore the fundamental concepts and technologies that power modern web applications.

We'll begin with an introduction to web application development, where you'll learn the basics and set up your development environment. In the subsequent weeks, we'll delve into React, understanding components, props, state management, and architecture. You'll learn how to add interactivity to your applications, handle lists, and fetch data from APIs.

In the latter half of the course, we'll focus on server-side technologies and advanced React concepts. You'll get hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and REST APIs. We'll also cover Next.js, including routing and the different rendering methods.

The course will culminate in a project where you'll apply everything you've learned to build your own web application. The last week is reserved for an optional project showcase, where you can share your work with your peers.

In addition to the project, there are 10 small assignments due every two weeks.

Happy coding, and here's to a great semester together!

This whole week is dedicated to working on your project. I'll be available during class time to help you with any questions you may have.

Project Submission Information:

    When you are finished your project, you must submit this reflection form: https://forms.office.com/r/kT8RimSU4c
    There is no need to submit your project code since I already have your project GitHub repository. I will be grading your project based on the reflection form and the project itself.
    The reflection form due is due Tuesday December 10, 2024 at 11:59 pm. Everyone must submit the form individually.
    Failure to submit the reflection form will result in a grade of zero for the project.
    More details here: https://webdev2.warsylewicz.ca/week-14

Good luck!

## Week 15: Project Showcase

Last Chance for Submissions

Reminder that the project and reflection form are due Tuesday at 11:59 pm.

In addition, as per the deadline policy, you have until Tuesday December 10, 2024 at 11:59 pm to submit any late assessments. No submissions will be accepted after Tuesday December 10, 2024 at 11:59 pm. This includes any late assignments, project topic form, or project reflection form. This is a hard deadline. No exceptions.
