# Weekly Announcements

## Before Start of Semester

Title: Welcome to CPRG-306!

Welcome to Web Development 2! In this course we'll explore the fundamental concepts and technologies that power modern web applications.

We'll begin with an introduction to web application development, where you'll learn the basics and set up your development environment. In the subsequent weeks, we'll delve into React, understanding components, props, state management, and architecture. You'll learn how to add interactivity to your applications, handle lists, and fetch data from APIs.

In the latter half of the course, we'll focus on server-side technologies and advanced React concepts. You'll get hands-on experience with Firebase Authentication, Cloud Firestore, and REST APIs. We'll also cover Next.js, including routing and the different rendering methods.

The course will culminate in a project where you'll apply everything you've learned to build your own web application. The last week is reserved for an optional project showcase, where you can share your work with your peers.

In addition to the project, there are 10 small assignments due every two weeks.

Happy coding, and here's to a great semester together!
